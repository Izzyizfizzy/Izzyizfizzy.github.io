## Welcome to Izzy's Website

This website is currently being updated. Most of my relevant information can be found on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ismael-tahoun-6a031999/) where you can learn more about my academic and engineering work experience.

### About me

I was born in Egypt in 1995 and have been moving around the world my whole life, flying out for the first time when I was only 2 weeks old. I became a naturalized US citizen in April 2018.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Izzyizfizzy/Izzyizfizzy.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
